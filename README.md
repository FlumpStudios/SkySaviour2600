# Sky Saviour 2600

Sky Saviour 2600 is an Atari 2600 port of my homebrew shmup of the same name.

If you just want the ROM, you can download it from itch.io [here](https://flump-studios.itch.io/sky-saviour-2600)
## How to play

Defend the futuristic city of NeoCov from bizarre alien insect invaders! Your mission is to intercept and eliminate the enemies before they reach the city center.

Use the fire button to shoot down the alien threats, but there's a catch, you can only carry 6 bullets at a time. To reload, descend into NeoCov city center. Drop down into NeoCov city centre to reload, beware however, whilst in the city you are unable to shoot.

If you see a failling "P" be sure to collect it, this will add 50 points to your score, reset you bullets and clear the screen of enemies

Colliding with an enemy, an enemy bullet or allowing an enemy to reach the city will result in a game over!

Don't worry if you find yourself dying super often, Sky Saviour is meant to be played in short, intense sessions.

## Scoring
The fewer bullets you have left, the more points you earn for each shot. For example, if you have 6 bullets left, each successful shot gives you 1 point, but if you have only 1 bullet left, each successful shot gives you 6 points. Try not to reload too often to maximize your score

## Caring is sharing
Sky Saviour 2600 is another fun hobby project for written over 2 few weeks, so if you enjoy my little game, please feel free to share, hack and crack away! 

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to play my little game, I hope you enjoy it :)
